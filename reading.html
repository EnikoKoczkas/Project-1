    <h1>What type of books do I like?</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>When I read a book, it helps me escape from the reality. 
    Suddenly I'm in a different city, state or world. I can be someone else. 
    I feel, those characters became my friends. My favorite genres are adventure 
    books, fantasy books and scientific books about the Universe.</p>
