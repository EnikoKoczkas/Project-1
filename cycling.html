    <h1>Why do I like cycling?</h1>
    <hr />
    <ul>
        <li>It reduces my stress level</li>
        <li>It keeps me fit</li>
        <li>It improves creative thinking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In spring and summer I go for cycling trip as frequent as I can.
    I like to explore the local area on 2 wheels. I also like virtual challanges. 
    Currently I'm doing the Great Barrier Reef challange.</p>
